# Creating a Folder

A Folder is a container for you to store messages away from your [Inbox][1] or [Activities][2]. It is accessible from the [Messages Tab][1] making it quick and easy to access messages in Folders. You could use a folder to store messages from your [inbox][1] that you need to refer to quickly without having to go through all your messages. This help page will explain the steps required for creating a new folder.
