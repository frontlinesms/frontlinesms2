# Using the Pending Folder

The pending folder contains the queue of messages that are waiting to be sent out by FrontlineSMS. From this folder, you can view those messages which have failed to send and attempt to resend them. Messages that have been successfully sent will be automatically moved from the pending folder to the [sent folder][1]. You can also [move][2], [archive][3], [export][4] and [delete][2] messages in the pending folder.

![Pending][12]

### Retrying to Send a Failed Message or Messages

Messages that have failed sending will be indicated by a yellow warning triangle (1).

1.  Select the message(s) you want to retry.
2.  In the message details area (2), click on the 'retry' button.  
If you have multiple failed messages selected then click "Retry All".
If you have multiple messages selected, where only some messages failed sending, clicking "Retry Failed" will make the system attempt to re-send only the failed messages in your selection.

The system will attempt to send your message(s). If they fail to send again, the message will remain in the pending folder with a warning triangle.

### Re-sending Failed Messages in an Activity

When you create an [activity][8], the messages are placed into the pending folder in a container. In place of the recipient information, this container will display the numebr of recipients the message was sent to (3). 

If some messages failed to send you can resend them using the same method outlined above
