# Using SMPP with FrontlineSMS

[The Short Message Peer-to-Peer (SMPP) protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_Message_Peer-to-Peer) is a protocol used to send messages over an internet connection to a Short Message Service Center (SMSC), which is typically owned by a mobile telephony provider. This is an advanced FrontlineSMS feature; most users who want to connect to Frontline to a mobile network should do so through [an Android phone][1], or [any other supported phone or usb modem][2].

The use of SMPP to send and receive messages requires a pre-negotiated agreement with the mobile provider, as the service is typically closed to the general public. In some cases, internet aggregators allow third party applications like FrontlineSMS to connect to them using the SMPP protocol, which is a more common use case for the FrontlineSMS SMPP functionality.

The configuration details required to connect to an SMSC vary from case to case. The fields that are configurable in the SMPP connection in Frontline are:

* the **URL** that the SMSC accepts SMPP traffic through
* the **port** that the SMSC expects traffic to be routed through
* the **username** for your account with this SMSC
* the **password** for your account
* the **From Number**, which will be the number that messages sent through this connection will originate from
* the name you want your connection to be saved under

All fields except the name should be populated with values provided by the other party.
